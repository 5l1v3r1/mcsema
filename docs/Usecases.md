# Why use mcsema?

## Analyze a binary rather than the source

Source level analysis is great, but not always possible (you don't have the source) and doesn't always catch everything (when your analysis tools disagree with your compiler, you're going to have a bad time). Lifting the actual binary to perform analysis helps guarantee that you're analyzing the behavior of the produced binary.

## Write one set of analysis tools

Lifting to LLVM IR means that you can write all analysis tools to operate within the llvm framework, meaning that your tools can work on both projects where source is available (process from source to llvm ir and perform analysis) and where source isn't available (lift via mcsema to llvm ir and perform analysis). Rather than having to develop two separate analysis toolchains, mcsema will allow you to be more efficient and develop just one.

## Modify a binary

Lift to llvm ir and now you can run mutation passes over the program: add features! remove features! rewrite features! fix that pesky typo or grammatical error or insane logic! When done, your new creation can be recompiled to a new binary sporting all those changes.

## Open source

Mcsema is open source: there are no hidden surprises, and if you find a bug you can fix the bug (and submit a pull request so that others will know you fixed that bug and be grateful to you). You get the benefit of the community fixing bugs and building extensions that you can use.

# Example and historical uses

## Mcsema -> KLEE

[KLEE](https://klee.github.io/) operates on llvm bitcode, usually generated by providing source to the llvm toolchain. Mcsema can lift a binary to llvm bitcode, permitting KLEE to operate on previously unavailable targets.

## Apache

As an example of how robust the mcsema lifting process is, the Apache web server program has been lifted by mcsema into llvm bitcode which was subsequently recompiled back into a binary form an executed. The resulting binary will run and serve pages.

## libFuzzer
[libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) operates on llvm ir. Work is ongoing to make mcsema lifted ir compatible with libfuzzer.
